It works by randomly \"dropping out\" or deactivating a subset of neurons during each training iteration. Here's how dropout facilitates regularization:\n**Reduces Co-adaptations**: By randomly dropping a subset of neurons, dropout prevents the network's units from co-adapting too much. Without all neurons present at each iteration, the network cannot rely on the presence of specific other neurons to correct its mistakes, forcing each neuron to learn features that are useful in a more independent way.\n**Model Averaging**: Dropout can be interpreted as a way of training a large ensemble of neural networks with shared weights. During training, each iteration effectively uses a different \"thinned\" network, which sees only a fraction of the units. At test time, the full network is used, which can be considered as an averaging ensemble of these smaller networks, leading to reduced variance in predictions.\n**Noise Injection**: Dropout introduces noise into the training process, as different neurons are dropped out randomly. This helps the model to learn more robust features that are invariant to the introduced perturbations.\n**Reduces Overfitting**: Overfitting happens when a model learns to memorize the training data rather than generalizing from it. By randomly dropping out neurons, dropout limits the amount of information that flows through the network, which makes it harder for the network to memorize the training data and encourages it to generalize better.\n**Increases Effective Model Complexity**: With dropout, the network's effective capacity is reduced for each training iteration, but the overall model complexity is preserved. The full capacity of the network is used for inference, while during training, the model's capacity is adapted dynamically.\n"}
